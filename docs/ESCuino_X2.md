Welcome to the ESCuino Wiki

The ESCuino is an open-source project by Curren Dynamics, created to empower the maker and R/C hobbyist communities with a flexible, Arduino-compatible dual brushed motor ESC (Electronic Speed Controller). Designed with versatility and customization in mind, ESCuino combines the power of a fully user-programmable microcontroller with robust, high-performance motor drivers—all in one compact board.

What is ESCuino?
At its core, ESCuino is more than just an ESC—it's a development platform. Based on the popular ATmega328P microcontroller and compatible with the Arduino IDE, it allows makers to write custom firmware, integrate sensors, automate control logic, or simply run their R/C vehicles with precise and reliable power delivery.

Whether you're prototyping a robotics project, customizing your next R/C boat, or building educational tools, ESCuino gives you the hardware foundation and software freedom to go further.
