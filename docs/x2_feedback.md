## Community Feedback

This is a compilation of community suggestion and our planned responses. This list will be added to as we continue to recieve brilliant suggestions from the Arduino and Remote Controlled communities.

- Suggestion: Adding mounting holes in the same layout as the UNO R3
    - We are currently reviewing the component layout and trace routing to determine if this can be accomplished without a major re-design. If possible this will be added to the first production version of the development board. 
- Suggestion: Shield compatibility with UNO R3
    - Likely not possible without a considerable redesign for V1.0, however this will be added as a primary design parameter for V2.0
- Suggestion: Adding I2C along with a quiic connector
    - This will certainly be a primary design parameter for V2.0, and potentially even added to the smaller non-dev version of the ESCuino. The ability to add multiple sensors and additional peripherals without the need for exposing a large number of IO would be a brilliant addition, and we are particularly excited about the possibilities this might open up once implemented.
