## Primary goals for the board:

- Roughly the same size and shape as Arduino Pro Micro
- XT30 connector for battery input
- Voltage regulation circuit to feed the Pro Micro and radio reciever
- Three pin header with standard servo |+|-|S| configuration
- DRV8245 motor driver with solder pads to connect to a brushed motor 

## Secondary goals for the board:

- DRV8245 should be able to provide the Pro Micro with current sensing
- The servo signal should support being programmed as an F.Port channel for serial communication with the radio reciever enabling multiple channel inputs and telemetry feedback from the Arduino 
- Package size of 37mm x 18mm

This project is currently in the prototyping and testing stage. Currently awaiting delivery of the Mighty Mouse development board V1.0.2 which we will use for testing various settings and configurations that are typically hardware configured on the DRV8245, as well as firmware for the Arduino Pro Micro. Once the functionality we desire from the DRV8245 has been accomplished with the Dev 1.0.2, then we will finalize trace routing and begin manufacture of the first protoypes of the Mighty Mouse Pro Mico.
