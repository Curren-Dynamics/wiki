The Mighty Mouse project aims to provide a small, programmable and cheap ESC shield for the Arduino Pro Micro platform.
---

 Our primary goals for the board include

- Same size and shape as Arduino Pro Micro
- XT30 connector for battery input
- Voltage regulation circuit to feed the Pro Micro and radio reciever
- Three pin header with standard servo |+|-|S| configuration
- DRV8245 motor driver with solder pads to connect to a brushed motor 

Our secondary goals for the board are

- DRV8245 should be able to provide the Pro Micro with current sensing
- The servo signal should support being programmed as an F.Port or S.Port channel for serial communication with the radio reciever enabling multiple channel inputs and telemetry feedback from the Arduino 
- Package size of 37mm x 18mm 


This project is still in the design stage.
