## üß† Microcontroller

### ATmega328P-PN
- 8-bit AVR MCU running at 16 MHz
- 32 KB Flash / 2 KB SRAM / 1 KB EEPROM
- Arduino Uno R3 pinout and bootloader compatible
- Operates at 5V, with AVCC decoupled and filtered
- Exposes UART, SPI, I¬≤C, PWM, and ADC pins on 0.1" headers

## ‚ö° Power Regulation

### MAX17502FATB+T
- High-efficiency, synchronous step-down converter
- Input range: 4.5V to 60V
- Output: 5V regulated (used to power MCU and logic)
- Internal compensation and soft-start
- Integrated MOSFET, 500kHz switching frequency

**Use case:** Powers logic and USB devices from battery voltage.

## üîå USB-UART Interface

### CP2102-GMR
- USB to UART bridge
- Full-speed USB 2.0
- Supports onboard serial flashing of the ATmega328P
- Works with Arduino IDE via standard USB CDC drivers

**Connector:** USB-C (HYCW445-USBC16-730B)

## üîß Motor Drivers

### DRV8245HQPWPRQ1 √ó2
Two independent H-bridge motor drivers (one per motor):

- Supply voltage (VM): 4.5V ‚Äì 37V
- Max continuous output current: **6.5A RMS**
- Peak output current: up to 10‚Äì14A (depending on cooling and duty cycle)
- Integrated power FETs (no external FETs needed)
- Control: PH/EN or PWM/PWM modes
- Current sensing via IPROPI pin (proportional to output current)
- Built-in protections: overcurrent, undervoltage, thermal shutdown, short-circuit

**Note:** Each motor channel can safely sustain ~6.5A continuous with proper PCB heat dissipation. Higher peak currents are possible for brief durations.

## üõ† Notes for Designers

- **Grounding:** PGND and logic GND are clearly separated; star grounding is recommended at the power input.
- **VIN filtering:** Bulk and high-frequency caps present, but layout should be reviewed for thermal/via optimization.
- **Modularity:** Can serve as both an ESC and a general-purpose Arduino-compatible controller with motor drivers.
