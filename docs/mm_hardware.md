## üß© Major Components

| Component              | Part Number               | Function                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Motor Driver**       | `DRV8245HQPWRQ1` (TI)      | Automotive-grade integrated H-bridge driver for brushed DC motors. Supports advanced current sensing, fault diagnostics, and low-power sleep modes. |
| **Buck Regulator**     | `LMR51430YFDDCR` (TI)      | 36‚ÄØV input-capable switching buck converter. Steps VIN down to +5V for logic and IO rail. |
| **TVS Protection**     | `SMAJ30A`, `SMAJ30CA`      | Protects VIN and motor outputs from surge and back-EMF transients. |
| **Power Connector**    | `XT30AW-M`                 | Compact XT30 connector supports battery inputs or external DC supplies. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Input / Output Pins

| Pin        | Function                            |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| `PH`, `EN` | Motor direction (EN) and speed control (PH)  |
| `DIAG`     | Fault/status output from DRV8245    |
| `ITRIP`, `IPROPI` | Current limit and proportional current feedback |
| `MODE`, `nSLEEP`, `nFAULT` | Operational modes and diagnostic interface |
| `DRVOFF`   | Driver disable pin                  |
| `VM`       | Power input for motor driver (shared with VIN) |
| `LOAD1`, `LOAD2` | Motor output terminals (OUT1/OUT2 of single H-bridge) |

## üîå Power Input & Output

- **Input Voltage**: Up to 36‚ÄØV nominal (limited to 30V by TVS protection diodes)
- **Output Voltage**: Matches VIN (direct from input to motor)
- **5V Logic Rail**: Generated by onboard buck converter for internal and external use

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Features

- **VIN TVS Diode**: `SMAJ30A` clamps surges above 30V on the input supply line
- **Motor Output TVS**: `SMAJ30CA` located between LOAD1 and LOAD2 to absorb inductive spikes
- **On-chip Protection**: DRV8245 provides overcurrent, thermal shutdown, undervoltage lockout, and fault reporting

## üìê Design Considerations

- **Footprint-optimized** for micro-scale or embedded systems
- All major I/Os are routed to a single inline 13-pin header for simplicity
- Decoupling and TVS placement carefully balanced to ensure protection without bloating PCB size
- Designed for modular testing and future integration into compact platforms
