## üß© Major Components

| Component              | Part Number               | Function                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Motor Driver**       | `DRV8245HQPWRQ1` (TI)      | Automotive-grade **single H-bridge** driver for brushed DC motors. Supports advanced current sensing, fault diagnostics, and low-power sleep modes. |
| **Buck Regulator**     | `LMR51430YFDDCR` (TI)      | 36‚ÄØV input-capable switching buck converter. Steps VIN down to +5V for logic and IO rail. |
| **TVS Protection**     | `SMAJ33A`, `SMAJ30CA`      | Protects VIN and motor outputs from surge and back-EMF transients. |
| **Power Connector**    | `XT30AW-M`                 | Compact XT30 connector supports battery inputs or external DC supplies. |
| **Logic Header**       | `HX PM2.54-1√ó13P`          | 13-pin 2.54‚ÄØmm pitch header exposes control pins for logic inputs, fault monitoring, and driver configuration. |
| **Capacitors**         | `10‚ÄØ¬µF`, `47‚ÄØ¬µF`, etc.     | Local bulk capacitance and filtering for power stability. Decouples VM, VCC, and motor outputs. |
| **Inductor**           | `6.8‚ÄØ¬µH`                   | Main inductor for the buck converter. Chosen for efficiency and transient response. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Input / Output Pins

| Pin        | Function                            |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| `PH`, `EN` | Motor direction and enable control  |
| `DIAG`     | Fault/status output from DRV8245    |
| `ITRIP`, `IPROPI` | Current limit and proportional current feedback |
| `MODE`, `nSLEEP`, `nFAULT` | Operational modes and diagnostic interface |
| `DRVOFF`   | Driver disable pin                  |
| `VM`       | Power input for motor driver (shared with VIN) |
| `LOAD1`, `LOAD2` | Motor output terminals (OUT1/OUT2 of single H-bridge) |

## üîå Power Input & Output

- **Input Voltage**: Up to 36‚ÄØV nominal (limited by TVS and DRV VM max)
- **Output Voltage**: Matches VIN (direct from VM to motor)
- **5V Logic Rail**: Generated by onboard buck converter for internal and external use

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Features

- **VIN TVS Diode**: `SMAJ33A` clamps surges on the input supply line
- **Motor Output TVS**: `SMAJ30CA` placed across LOAD1 and LOAD2 to absorb inductive spikes
- **On-chip Protection**: DRV8245 provides overcurrent, thermal shutdown, undervoltage lockout, and fault reporting

## üìê Design Considerations

- **Footprint-optimized** for micro-scale or embedded systems
- All major I/Os are routed to a single inline 13-pin header for simplicity
- Decoupling and TVS placement carefully balanced to ensure protection without bloating PCB size
- Designed for modular testing and future integration into compact platforms
